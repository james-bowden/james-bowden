Hi, I'm a rising sophomore at Caltech with machine learning and bioinformatics experience (and quite a bit of biomedical research background). Iâ€™m looking to develop impactful data processing/analysis techniques and related software.

My current interests include: ML, adaptive experiment design, deep learning, data science, CV, NLP, bioinformatics, biological abstractions, cell-computer interfacing.

I'm open to both research and industry internship opportunities for Summer 2021 and would love to chat, so please don't hesitate to reach out!
